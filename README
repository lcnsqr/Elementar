Elementar CMS

Elementar is a simple (yet efficient) Web CMS based on CodeIgniter 
framework. Itâ€™s purpose is to offer the publisher/designer full control 
on what is delivered to the browser. Therefore, Elementar lacks a theme 
support as it requires a full layout built from scratch by the Web 
Designer.

In other hand, Elementar has a strong structured way of maintaining the 
website data. Pages (called contents) and fragments (called elements) 
are organized in a hierarchical way, as simple as files and folders in 
your documents folder.

Features for publishers/designers
	- Full HTML/CSS/Javascript control
	- Template system
	- Auto generated sitemap.xml
	- SEO URLs
	- Content cache system
	- I18N support

Features for developers
	- Open Source (GPL)
	- Focused on code correctness
	- MVC approach
	- SCM by Git (at Github)
	- Supports Mysql or Postgres databases
	- Backend programming relies on both server side (PHP/CodeIgniter) 
	  and client side (Javascript/jQuery)
	- Support for custom made Controllers (addons)

Feel free to fork and use it. Elementar is in continuous development 
towards 1.0 release.
